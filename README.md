Rather than defining groups before looking at the data, clustering allows you to find and analyze the groups that have formed organically.

###  k-means algorithm

_k_-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have  data without defined categories or groups. The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable  _k_. The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of  _k_ groups based on the features that are provided. Data points are clustered based on feature similarity.

The results of the  _k_-means clustering algorithm are:
1.  The centroids of the  _k_ clusters, which can be used to label new data.
2.  Labels for the training data.

### MaxMin algorithm
Max-min clustering proceeds by choosing an observation at random as the  first centroid `c1`, and by setting the set `C` of centroids  to `{c1}`. During the `i`th iteration, `ci` is chosen such  that it maximizes the minimum Euclidean distance between `ci` and observations in `C`.
